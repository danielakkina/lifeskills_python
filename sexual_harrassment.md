#  Sexual Harassment Prevention

##  What is Sexual Harassment?
- Unwanted touching, staring, or invading personal space  
- Passing sexual jokes, comments, or gestures  
- Sharing inappropriate texts, images, or videos  
- Asking for sexual favors or making suggestive remarks  
- Any behavior that makes someone feel unsafe or uncomfortable  

##  What Should You Do?
- **Report immediately** to the company’s complaint team or HR  
- **Write down details**: date, time, place, and people involved  
- **Support the victim** – listen, encourage, and stand with them  
- **Follow company rules** – use the official complaint process  
- **Speak up** – silence allows harassment to continue
