## 2. Reflective Listening

**Key Points of Reflective Listening (Fisher's Model)**  
Reflective listening, as explained by Fisher's model, emphasizes understanding and confirming the speaker’s message. Here are the main aspects:
- **Listen and Mirror**: Focus on both the words and emotions of the speaker. Mirror back your understanding to validate their feelings.
- **Clarify and Confirm**: Ask clarifying questions to avoid misunderstandings.
- **Encourage the Speaker**: Use body language and verbal responses to motivate the speaker to share more.
- **Summarize Regularly**: Repeat or summarize key points to ensure mutual understanding.

Reflective listening is especially effective in high-stakes or emotionally charged situations, helping to foster trust and clarity.
