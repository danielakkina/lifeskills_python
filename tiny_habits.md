# Tiny Habits & Atomic Habits – Reflection

## 1. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg

## 2. Tiny Habits – Core Message
**Q2. How can you use B = MAP to make habits easier?**  
- **B = MAP → Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt**  
- **M (Motivation):** Desire to act.  
- **A (Ability):** How easy it is.  
- **P (Prompt):** Reminder or trigger.  
To build habits, lower the difficulty and use prompts. Motivation alone isn’t enough.

**Q3. Why celebrate after each habit?**  
Because *emotions create habits*. When we celebrate (smile, fist pump, say “Yes!”), the brain feels good and wants to repeat the action. Celebration is like habit glue.
